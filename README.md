# Utility - MathNET - Continuous Distributions

The Math.NET Numerics library provides a wide range of probability distributions. Given the distribution parameters they can be used to investigate their statistical properties or to sample non-uniform random numbers.

All the distributions implement a common set of operations such as evaluating the density (PDF) and the cumulative distribution (CDF) at a given point, or to compute the mean, standard deviation and other properties. Because it is often numerically more stable and faster to compute such statistical quantities in the logarithmic domain, we also provide a selection of them in the log domain with the "Ln" suffix, e.g. DensityLn for the logarithmic density.

This asset covers 17 continuous distributions. There are 2 additional distributions but they proved to be to unreliable during testing phase so have been removed from this asset for the time being. The remaining 10 discrete and 6 multivariate distributions will be available in later assets.
